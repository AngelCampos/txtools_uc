              RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing the RNA structure. Messenger
              RNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial
              pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function--it changes
              the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in
              the ribosome decoding centre. However, without evidence of
              naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological
              relevance was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis
              of pseudouridylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human RNAs
              using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution
              method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately
              identifies known modification sites as well as many novel sites
              in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated
              sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the
              new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine
              synthases, Pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of
              pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental
              signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum
              starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for
              the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through
